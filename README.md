# Sevdalinka Generator
## Paper and project for ML course

### WIP
- Added `virutalenv`:
    - Run `python -m venv env` to create the virtual environment.
    - `source env/bin/activate` to use the environment.
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
- `model.py` - basic model for character-by-character generation
- `generate.py` - generate text
- **NOTE**: `nvvm` was required to run Tensorflow GPU locally.
